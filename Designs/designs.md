##FONTS
I have compiled some of the _**best and appealing fonts**_ of 2020 in the list below:
1. Poppins
2. Cairo
3. Roboto
4. Montserrat
5. Source Sans Pro

##DESIGN COMBINATIONS
Based on my research, an application like a _**TODO app should be "Clean" and also punchy colors as well have noisy backgrounds should be avoided**_ so that the user can focus on main things of the webpage.

Hence I've complied a set of combinations of Color Palettes, Illustrations and logos that can be used to achive the above concept.

###Combination 1
We can use _**Combi_Illustration_1**_ on a white background with color combinations form _**Combi_Palette_1**_ and we can use _**Combi_Logo_1**_ as our logo.

Similarly for the other combinations! Please
